            <p>Since the first release of the MacBook Air back in 2008, many have considered Apple's take on the netbook priced itself out the market for most users.  But in October 2010, Apple announced a grand refresh to it's line of ultra-portable laptop.  The major shift in the new Airs comes from the eradication of the conventional hard drive.  They have even neglected the standard Solid State Drives because they were just too thick!  Instead, Apple has designed the new Airs with the SSD chips being placed directly onto the main board.  The argument for this is that it has freed space which used to be taken up by the SSD enclosure.  This has resulted in a machine that is thinner, lighter and most importantly, has a longer battery life than ever before! Apple have also released an 11.6" version alongside the 13.3".</p>
            
            <p>"...thinner, lighter and a longer battery life!"</p>

			<p>The question is: how does this affect iPad sales?  With the introduction of an 11.6" Air, especially with a starting price of Â£849, many think that it will swing many would-buy iPad buyers over to the MacBook Air.  While Apple claimed to have learnt a lot from the iPad and brought some of it's features (such as instant wake) to the Air, I still believe that the Air will attract the same market as before, whereas the iPad is narketed as a fun all round device.  Even though the increase in popularity with the Air may not be huge, it is still an insight into the future where all laptops will be (even) lighter, thinner, but most importantly, be running totall on SSDs.  I believe that we are at the start of the future of notebooks, where they will become generic, always connected to the cloud devices.</p>
