            <p>The past 12 months has made it a great year for film-goers.  With blockbusters such as Inception, Harry Potter, Toy Story 3 and of course Avatar, which was still getting bums in seats a whole year after it's original release date!  Whether you think Avatar was actually a well written film, or just a cliched story which many dubbed as 'Smurfahontus', it was the new experience of 3D which really gained people's attention.  However, you have to look at what this actually brings to the movie watching experience.</p>

			<p>3D has been around as long as cinema itself, not forgetting those red and blue 3D glasses from the 1980s which were fashioned well in cult classics such as Back to the Future.  But technology has changed a bit in the last 30 years.  3D films now offer a truly immersive experience for viewers.  It allows film makers to really grab the audience's attention into what's being shown on screen, which is where the real skill lies in 3D film-making.  The success of Avatar was said to no be because objects fly out of the screen at you, but instead, the 3D effect litterally gives you a greater sense of depth of field, which is especially exciting while flying through the sky of a floating archipelago.</p>
            
            <p>However, the problem comes when the 3D technique is gimmickly used - it just makes the extra cost seem like a waste of money.  This is especially true when you have to have  some overly-sized, tight and uncomfortable glasses perched on your face.  Worst things worse, 3D is said to reduce the colour vibrance by 30% in cinemas.  Until 3D can work without the need for glasses - especially when it comes to 3D TV - for me at least, it will always seem like a gimmick.</p>
